# edoclitecreation

The intention of this project is to create the xml files 
needed to build an Kuali Rice eDoc Lite from scratch. 

Much of it is specific to IU. I will add info here as it gets further developed.

First piece of work needed is to gather the program codes for the departments
from the student information system (SIS).

private.py contains oracle connection info and SQL needed to get data from SIS.
It also contains local path variables from writing files out as needed.
